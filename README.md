## Belly Button Buddies

In this assignment, I was asked to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

To accomplish this, I used the D3 library to read in a json dataset from the URL provided, then used the data to create a horizontal bar and bubble chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual. I also created a display for the individual's demographic information, with an option to cycle through samples, showing different charting and data.
